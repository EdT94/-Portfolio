# Portfolio
My portfolio website.

After self-studying web technologies in my second year of academic studies, I built a portfolio website. Implemented in "Atom", with HTML, CSS, and javascript(node.js as backend) technologies. The EC2 container runs with a help of a docker image stored on DockerHub. Link:
