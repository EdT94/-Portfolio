# Portfolio
My portfolio website.

After self-studying web technologies in my second year of academic studies, I built a portfolio website. HTML, CSS, and javascript(node.js as backend) are used. The App is hosted on AWS as an EC2 instance. The EC2 container is built from an image stored on DockerHub.
